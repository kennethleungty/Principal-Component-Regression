# Principal Component Regression (PCR) - Clearly Explained and Implemented
Understanding the regression analysis technique based on principal component analysisÂ (PCA)

Link to article: *Coming Soon*

## Overview
- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-known dimensionality reduction technique, but did you know that we can also apply the concepts behind PCA in regression analysis? 
- This project provides a clear explanation of principal component regression (PCR), including its theoretical concept, benefits, caveats, and Python implementation.

## Contents
- `/data`: Datasets for the PCR analysis (diamond quality and wine quality data)
- `/notebooks`: Notebooks demonstrating the implementation of PCR
- `/images`: Images/screenshots involved in project

## Results
